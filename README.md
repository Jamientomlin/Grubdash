# Grubdash
This app was designed to mimic a food delivery app like GrubHub or Doordash. Users can add items to a card, as well as manage and delete from the cart itself. I designed a RESTful API for the backend of a restaurant app utilizing Express.js and Node.js.The front end was designed using React, and Bootstrap. <br>
